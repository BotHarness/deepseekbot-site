This guide covers non-IM settings in the public **deepseekbot** package on DSH **0.2.0-rc.1**: where to open them, what each field does, and when changes apply. Complete [installation](/docs/installation) and [API / Bot model setup](/docs/model-setup) first. Slack and Lark account/connection fields remain in their connection guides. Screenshots show the verified Chinese UI.

## DSH general settings

These are native DSH settings. Initial values below were observed in a clean RC1 Profile; existing Profiles may retain different choices. Selectors and switches save directly. Fields with a Save button require that button.

## Agent presets and built-in plugins

**Agent presets** select native tools and working style. “Set as default for new tasks” applies to subsequent native tasks. Review each preset's configuration, description, and usage instructions first. These are separate from [Bot model presets](/docs/model-setup).

![Native Agent presets select tools and working style](/guides/settings/settings-agent-presets-zh.webp)

| Preset                     | Use                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard (initial default) | Most code, file, and research tasks.                                                              |
| PTC                        | Batch tool calls and filtering, deduplicating, counting, or summarizing results.                  |
| Minimal                    | Terminal-based tasks; baseline testing and comparison.                                            |
| Creation / Cordis          | Write DSH plugins and compose tools/prompts to extend DSH.                                        |
| Custom                     | Use “Let an Agent help me create a preset”; inspect its configuration and instructions afterward. |

**Built-in plugins** supports search, Session/Global plugin groups, selection of the Agent preset to inspect, and plugin status/details. Third-party fields depend on each installed plugin and are not all required DeepSeekBot settings. Install/enable packages using [Installation](/docs/installation). Advanced deployment layers and BotHarness configuration keys are linked at the end of this page.

## Global Bot settings

![Bot appearance, sorting, developer mode, and task concurrency](/guides/settings/settings-bot-global-zh.webp)

| Field                         | Default / options                                       | Save and effect                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bot icon                      | DeepSeekBot mascot; simple, generated, or generic robot | Click to save. Changes the app/sidebar settings marker, not each Bot's avatar.                                                                                            |
| Motion                        | System; reduced or full                                 | Selection saves immediately. The preview reports effective motion.                                                                                                        |
| Bot list sorting              | Recently updated; manual                                | Default sorting; drag rows for manual order. Pinned areas/sections may have their own sort choice.                                                                        |
| Developer mode                | Off                                                     | Shows workspace grant history and advanced options; grants no file access.                                                                                                |
| Auto-accept Group invitations | On                                                      | Join invited BotHarness Groups without waking the Bot. When off, the invited Bot decides. Does not configure an IM connection.                                            |
| Assignment concurrency limit  | 3; integer 1–32                                         | Enter and Save. Shared across Bots; limits executing tasks, not historical sessions. Lowering it does not stop running tasks.                                             |
| DeepSeekBot version           | Shows the running version                               | Check for updates queries npm; Update now installs a new release, and on the web Restart now loads it. See [Update DeepSeekBot](/docs/update-deepseekbot).                |
| My default name               | Empty → Human; maximum 128 characters                   | Save name for chat, mentions, and Bot context. Restore default or save empty to return to Human.                                                                          |
| Anonymous usage statistics    | On                                                      | Switch saves immediately and applies without a restart; locked off when config or environment disables it. See [Anonymous usage statistics](#anonymous-usage-statistics). |

The lower “External platform defaults” area belongs to IM intake/identity settings; see [Lark / Feishu](/docs/lark-connection) and [Slack](/docs/slack-connection).

## Create a Bot and edit its Profile

Use “Create your first PersonaBot” in Bot mode or the list's New menu.

| Field            | Configuration                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source           | Empty creates a new Memory Repository. Git import takes an accessible Git URL and uses that repository rather than showing blank-persona templates. |
| Name             | Required display name; rename later using the edit button beside the Profile name.                                                                  |
| Roles            | Optional badges; Enter/comma confirms a badge and its close button removes it. Badges do not grant capabilities.                                    |
| About            | Optional short introduction shown in the Profile.                                                                                                   |
| Persona template | Blank / colleague / roleplay seed for the creation text.                                                                                            |
| Persona          | Editable identity and communication instructions at creation; not model, API, or permission configuration.                                          |

![Bot creation fields and persona templates](/guides/install/06-create-bot-zh.webp)

After creation, open **View details**:

- **Change avatar**: choose PNG, JPEG, or WebP; adjust the crop and save. An uploaded avatar can be removed.
- **Design avatar**: choose illustrated/line style, presets, parts, shape sliders, and colors. Save applies the preview; cancel discards the draft. An uploaded image takes display precedence.
- **Activity overview**: pins select cards in the Profile popover. Token usage time range, model/provider grouping, filters, and custom dates change the statistics view, not the model. Unavailable usage is unknown rather than zero.
- **Model preset**: see [Model setup](/docs/model-setup) for every field, template revision, and independent snapshot.
- **Persona / memory files**: use Memory files in the right sidebar to inspect files and their available edit/preview actions. The Profile does not repeat every creation field as an editing form.
- **Standing memory limits**: character limits for `SOUL.md` and `MEMORY.md`, applied from the next Session; see [Bot Soul and Core Memory](/docs/soul-and-core-memory).

## Bot attention policy and local Groups

Expand **Attention policy** in the Profile. Edit the relevant source row and Save; Restore default removes its override. Read-only rows expose details, revision, actor, and recent wake counts.

![Assignment report attention editor and application scope](/guides/settings/settings-attention-zh.webp)

| Source / field                                                   | Options and effect                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Human DM, Bot DM, Group mention                                  | Immediate wake; choose “Fold into the running turn” (default) or “Queue as its own turn” for arrival during an active turn.                                  |
| Ordinary Group messages                                          | Immediate / digest / direct mentions / silent recording. Initial digest: 5 messages / 30 seconds. Count integer 1–100; interval integer 1–3600 seconds.      |
| Assignment reports                                               | Default wake by state/reply request, or wake on every report. Applies to reports entering the Inbox afterward; already queued reports retain their revision. |
| Group invitations, join requests/decisions, Assignment lifecycle | Read-only in this table; Details is not an edit action.                                                                                                      |

Local Groups allow an ordinary-message override for each Bot under **Group header → View details**. Inherit uses that Bot's default; edits/restoring inheritance are scoped to that Group. Group member controls manage invitations, join requests, and membership. These policies do not change API providers, models, or workspace permissions.

## Channel sidebar display settings

The [Channel sidebar chapter](/docs/channel-sidebar) provides step-by-step feature guides; see [Display and layout](/docs/channel-sidebar/display) for ordering, visibility and save/cancel behavior.

Open the right sidebar's gear menu. These browser display preferences do not change durable Bot memory or task authorization.

![Sidebar layout, memory terminology, and session view menus](/guides/settings/settings-sidebar-zh.webp)

| Field                          | Default / effect                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Edit sidebar                   | Drag entries into order, select visible entries, then finish. Bot DMs and Groups can use different layouts. |
| Memory evolution → Terminology | Memory terms by default; Git terms rename the same underlying commit view.                                  |
| Sessions → Scope               | Current by default; All expands the filter for that Bot's session view.                                     |
| Sessions → Layout              | Flat by default; optionally group by workspace.                                                             |
| Sidebar width                  | 320 px by default; drag the divider within 260–560 px. Sidebar/entry expanded states are retained too.      |

## Workspace grants and task permissions

Expand **Workspace grants** for the target Bot. Memory Repository is its memory directory. Use **Add folder** to choose extra task folders on the DSH Host; a remote browser does not substitute its own local paths.

![Workspace grants with no extra folder authorization](/guides/settings/settings-workspace-grants-zh.webp)

| Field / action                          | Effect and scope                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Add folder                              | Choose and confirm a task directory this Bot may use. Grants are managed separately for each Bot.                                                                                                            |
| Revoke/remove directory                 | Revoke its authorization for subsequent work; does not delete the directory's files.                                                                                                                         |
| Allow all file access for new work      | Off by default: new Assignments use workspace write and ask for approvals. Enabling requires explicit confirmation and applies full file access to new tasks, not existing permission snapshots.             |
| Tool approval rules                     | The actual prompt offers one-time approval, remembered exact operations, or broader rules. Inspect Bot, role, directory, and operation scope before confirming. Existing rules can be inspected and revoked. |
| Developer-mode history/advanced options | Inspect revoked grants and history. Showing them does not restore authorization.                                                                                                                             |

For a first task, choose one specific directory, retain default permissions, and verify an actual task. Model choice, directory authorization, and task permissions are separate settings.

## Anonymous usage statistics

DeepSeekBot sends anonymous usage statistics from the DSH Host by default; Bot mode explains this once in a notice the first time it opens. Events are tied only to a random install ID stored in `$DSH_HOME/botharness/telemetry.json`:

- `plugin_started`: plugin version, DSH version, operating system and architecture.
- `bot_created`, `bot_archived`, `bot_deleted`, `marketplace_bot_installed` and `avatar_edited`: only that the action happened.
- `connector_enabled`: only the connector type (`feishu`, `lark`, `slack`, `discord`, `weixin` or `other`).
- `daily_usage`: at most once a day, the number of PersonaBots, the number of new Sessions and messages since the previous summary, and that window's length in whole hours. No event is sent per message.
- `$exception`: when the Host hits an unhandled error in BotHarness code, the error type and its stack's functions and line numbers, with each file reduced to its package-relative name (such as `@botharness/core/dist/index.mjs`) or just its file name. Errors without a BotHarness frame are dropped. The report is saved on the device and sent on the next start; the error message is never included.

Names, Persona or Memory content, conversations, prompts, tool arguments, repository URLs, connector accounts or workspaces, your file paths, credentials and IP addresses are never sent. To turn it off, open **Bot settings** and switch off **Anonymous usage statistics**; it takes effect at once without a restart, queued events are dropped, and the choice is saved in the same `telemetry.json` so it survives restarts. Switching it back on resumes without a restart. Deployments can force it off with `telemetry: false` on the BotHarness core plugin (see Advanced parameters below) or by starting DSH with `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or `BOTHARNESS_TELEMETRY=0`; the switch is then shown off and disabled with a note naming the setting.

## Advanced parameters and optional capabilities

The public npm package composes Core, Client, and the qualified IM Provider. Browser/Computer development capabilities do not become available merely by following the npm installation steps. The generated [Core configuration reference](/dev/reference/config) covers `enabled`, `agentPreset` (session tool preset, default standard), `activityDetailConsumers` (trusted Host plugins allowed to read activity details, initially empty), and `telemetry` (anonymous usage statistics, default on). Optional Browser target, driver, path, headless, and idle-stop fields are defined in [Browser configuration](https://github.com/BotHarness/BotHarness/blob/main/packages/browser/src/index.ts); Computer target, desktop resources, export directory, and action authorization fields are defined in [Computer configuration](https://github.com/BotHarness/BotHarness/blob/main/packages/computer/src/index.ts). Existing operational guides cover [daily browser sharing](/docs/daily-browser) and [Computer export/transfer](/docs/computer-export).

Check the installed version, then inspect the relevant plugin under **Settings → Built-in plugins** for its details/parameters. Deployment fields without a form are configured through Profile/Patch layers as described by the [official DSH documentation](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/develop/basic/publish). The website's development reference can be newer than the npm release; optional capabilities there are not a claim about what this package includes.
