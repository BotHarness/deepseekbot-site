BotHarness gives you **PersonaBots**: bots with a persona and a memory that outlive any session. In the DSH Web UI you use them in **BOT mode**.

## Two modes

- **DSH mode** is the native harness: workspaces hold sessions, and you pick a folder to work in.
- **BOT mode** is chat-first: you talk to bots; sessions are execution detail behind the chat.

Switch modes with **BOT mode**, the entry under *New Session*. Clicking *New Session* always takes you back to DSH mode.

## Talking to a bot

- Clicking a bot opens a **DM** — a chat, not a session view. You do not see thinking or tool traces; that stays behind the scenes.
- **Group chats** (chatrooms) work like any IM: create a channel, add bots and people, and everyone reads and writes there.
- Send a message and the bot answers when it has processed it. Unread events show as dots until you read them.

## Channels and sections

A **Channel** is a conversation space. Its type is either **DM** (one bot and one person) or **group chat** (several members; informally a chatroom). A channel keeps its history locally, as readable files — your transcript is yours.

**Channel sections** are optional, collapsible groups you create to organize channels. They are a local arrangement, like folders in a chat app, and are never exported with a bot.

## Bot Inbox and Human Inbox

Each bot has a **Bot Inbox**: the events it admitted from its channels and bridges. A bot behaves like a person — it clears its inbox: reads, marks things read, and acts. It also reads channel history on demand, a little at a time, when older context matters.

The dashboard's **Human Inbox** aggregates everything that needs *you* across all bots.

For each channel, a bot's notification policy is `muted`, `mentions`, or `all` (default `all`: joining a channel means reading it). A direct mention always wakes the bot.

## Sessions, the right pane, and workspaces

A bot works in **sessions**. In a DM or channel, the right-hand panel lists the bot's sessions — status, workspace, recent activity — and lets you open one. It is read-only for now.

The bot's **main session** is long-lived: it watches the Bot Inbox and decides what to answer, dispatch, or open next. It appears in the right panel labelled *main session*.

Bots are not tied to one folder: they can work across your machine. Every session still runs in one workspace folder, and when a bot needs files outside its usual place it asks you first (DSH approval).

## Bridges

A **Bridge** connects an external source — a Lark group or thread, a live stream, a webhook — to a Channel or directly to a bot's Bot Inbox. It delivers incoming messages and knows where to send replies (the right Lark thread, for example).

Replies to external chats are sent by default without extra approval; other external actions still ask.

If you bridge a source that contains a message a bot already sent, that message can legitimately come back into an inbox. We record where every message came from — bridge, external thread, author — instead of silently blocking your configuration.

## Builder and creating bots

The first time you have no bots, a **Create a bot** button appears. It creates **Builder**: an ordinary bot with a standard persona that helps you create other bots by chatting. You can edit or delete it.

Afterwards, the **+** button offers two ways to create: talk to Builder, or fill in the form.

Any bot can create bots when its tool allow-list grants `bot_create`; Builder includes it by default.

## Memory

Persona and memory belong to the bot, not to a session: the same memory is present in every session, chat, and workspace. Conversation history lives in channels; session logs are execution traces, not your chat transcript.
