The BotHarness intro deck ships with the docs site and is rebuilt from the repo:

- [Open the intro deck](https://botharness.ai/slides/s/botharness-intro) — start from the cover, press `F` for fullscreen present mode
- [All decks](https://botharness.ai/slides/) — every deck under `apps/presentations/slides/`

## Iterate on the deck

Decks are React components on a fixed 1920×1080 canvas (open-slide). The authoring rules live in `apps/presentations/AGENTS.md`.

```bash
pnpm slides:dev # iterate at http://localhost:5173/s/<id>
pnpm slides:build # rebuild the botharness.ai/slides/ embed
```

`pnpm docs:build` rebuilds the embed automatically. The generated output under `apps/docs/public/slides/` is never committed — the deck sources are the authority.
