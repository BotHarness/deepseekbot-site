BotHarness is a **plugin layer on top of DeepSeek Harness (DSH)** that gives LLM agents a persistent identity: the **PersonaBot**.

Existing harnesses work one session at a time — across sessions there is at most a "cloud memory", with no Bot entity that has a persona and can work across conversations. That is the layer BotHarness fills:

- **PersonaBot**: a first-class entity — persona, cross-session memory, state, channel bindings, and several Sessions handled at once
- **Memory**: file-first (front-matter, directory-tree injection, tool-driven writes, git versioning)
- **How work happens**: delegation (@PersonaBot hands work off, executes it in the background, and reports back), with tiered approvals
- **No DSH fork**: delivered as an SDK + bundle; capabilities like IM come from bases such as dsh-im

## Two products

| Name | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **BotHarness** | The platform layer (this repository): PersonaBot entities, memory, state, and how work happens |
| **DeepSeekBot** | The first app: brings PersonaBots into the DSH sidebar (create, @-delegate, keep working) and connects Feishu / Lark |
