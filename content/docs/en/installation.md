Install the **DeepSeekBot** plugin in DeepSeek Harness (DSH), enable it and create your first PersonaBot. You install one product package; Core, Client and the qualified IM Provider arrive with it.

This guide uses the public npm prerelease **`deepseekbot@0.1.0-alpha.1`**, verified with **DSH `0.2.0-rc.1`**. It is an early preview. Screenshots show a clean Profile using the Chinese DSH interface; the captions name the corresponding controls. No repository checkout or local build is required.

## 1. Open Plugins

Start DSH and open its Web interface. If DSH is not installed yet, follow the [official DSH getting-started documentation](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/). Follow [API and Bot model setup](/docs/model-setup) to configure a provider first; apply a model preset in the Bot Profile after creating the Bot.

Click **Plugins (插件)** in the left sidebar, then **Add plugin (添加插件)**.

## 2. Enter the public package name

Paste this exact value into **Package name or address (包名或地址)**:

```text
deepseekbot@0.1.0-alpha.1
```

Keep **npm official registry (npm 官方源)** as the installation source and click **Install (安装)**. Wait for the installation task to finish.

_This field imports the package source. It is not a file-upload picker. The pinned version makes the installation repeatable._

## 3. Enable the installed plugin

The completed task shows **Installed (已安装)**, the package name and version **`0.1.0-alpha.1`**. Click **Enable now (立即启用)**. If you closed the task, return to Plugins and turn on **Enable deepseekbot (启用 deepseekbot)**.

Once enabled, **Bot mode (Bot 模式)** appears in the sidebar. In the verified RC1 setup it loaded immediately. If your DSH reports that a restart is required, restart the same DSH Profile and reopen its Web page.

## 4. Open Bot mode

Click **Bot mode (Bot 模式)**, then **Create your first PersonaBot (创建第一个 PersonaBot)**. Enter a name and click **Create (创建)**; role and description are optional.

Open the new Bot's DM and click its header name/avatar → **View details → Model preset**. Choose Orchestrator and Assignment models, then **Create and apply**. See [API and Bot models](/docs/model-setup) for all fields. Return to the DM and send a short greeting. A reply verifies that your model is usable as well as the plugin being enabled. Model credentials are configured in DSH; npm installation does not provide them.

![A real model reply in the freshly installed product after a cold restart](/guides/install/07-local-reply-zh.webp)

_The verification Bot answered a message sent through the Web DM after installation and a cold Host restart. Messaging app accounts remain disconnected._

See [Settings guide](/docs/settings) for appearance, concurrency, persona, attention, sidebar, and workspace authorization fields.

## 5. Connect a messaging app

The initial installation has no IM accounts connected. After the local DM works, follow [Connect a Bot to Lark / Feishu](/docs/lark-connection). App credentials, external identity binding and group authorization are separate steps; installing the plugin does not authorize external groups.

## Other installation methods

The [official DSH packaging reference](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/develop/basic/publish) also supports CLI installation into a named Profile:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile <your-profile> add deepseekbot@0.1.0-alpha.1
```

Use the Profile you actually start. Enable the plugin in that Profile's Plugins page afterward.

To import the same precompiled archive, download the [public npm tarball](https://registry.npmjs.org/deepseekbot/-/deepseekbot-0.1.0-alpha.1.tgz). In the Web interface, enter its **absolute path on the machine running DSH** in Package name or address; a path on a different browser machine is not a Host path. With the CLI you can instead use `dsh plugin --profile <your-profile> add ./deepseekbot-0.1.0-alpha.1.tgz` from the download directory.

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Package or version not found            | Check the exact package spelling and version, choose npm official registry and retry once registry metadata is available. |
| Installed but no Bot mode               | Enable deepseekbot in the current Profile; follow any DSH restart notice, then reload the Web page.                       |
| Bot mode works but the Bot cannot reply | Check the selected model and DSH credentials; installation and model access are separate.                                 |
| IM settings are empty                   | Add the app account through the connection guide; an empty account list is expected on first installation.                |

For source development rather than installation, see the [repository README](https://github.com/BotHarness/BotHarness#readme) and [local development guide](/dev/guides/client-bridge).
