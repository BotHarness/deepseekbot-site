Daily Browser lets one PersonaBot read a tab you explicitly share from Chrome or Edge, including its current login state. This first version is read-only: it cannot click, type, navigate, or read other tabs. You can return the tab at any time.

## Install the extension

Use a local DSH Web instance opened at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` or `http://localhost:<port>`. The extension only connects to the DSH Host on your computer.

1. Locate `packages/browser/extension` in the BotHarness checkout, or the `extension` directory in the installed Browser package.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome or `edge://extensions` in Edge.
3. Enable Developer mode, choose Load unpacked, and select that directory.
4. Pin **BotHarness Daily Browser** to the browser toolbar if you want an easier entry point.

This version is distributed as unpacked source. Chrome/Edge store distribution is a later step. Edge compatibility follows the MV3 APIs; this slice's real end-to-end evidence uses Chrome for Testing.

## Share and observe

1. In Bot settings, choose **Browser Target → Daily Browser**. This is shared by all Bots in this DSH Profile; switching requires new action approval.
2. Enable Browser Access for the intended Bot and open its Channel sidebar's Browser entry. Computer Access is not required.
3. Choose **Connect browser extension**. The pairing code expires after five minutes and can be used once.
4. Open the page you want to share in your daily browser. Click the extension icon, enter the local BotHarness address and pairing code, and choose **Connect**.
5. Check the Bot name and current page shown by the extension, then choose **Share current tab read-only**. Connecting alone does not share page content.
6. Ask that Bot to use `browser_observe`. Approve its first action when the existing Browser approval asks. The Bot reads bounded visible text and control labels from this document; it does not receive cookies or input values.

The Channel sidebar shows the shared title and address. The extension also shows **READ** while sharing. The Human continues browsing normally, but changing or reloading the shared document ends the lease.

## Return or reconnect

Choose **Return tab** in the extension or BotHarness sidebar. The tab stays open. Navigation, reload, closure, Browser Access removal, changing Browser Target, Host restart, browser restart, or disconnection also end borrowing. The maximum lease is 30 minutes; 45 seconds without polling invalidates a connection, checked on every operation and by a ten-second cleanup interval. Start a new pairing and Share flow to lend a tab again.

Internal browser pages, extension pages and browser-owned viewers cannot be shared through this flow. If pairing fails, check the local address, create a fresh code, and open the extension on an ordinary HTTP/HTTPS page.

## Control one existing Chrome document

Choose **Daily Chrome · Control** in Bot settings → Browser Target. This is separate from the read-only extension above.

1. Install Microsoft's [Playwright extension 0.4.0](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/playwright-extension/mmlmfjhmonkocbjadbfplnigmagldckm) in the Chrome profile you already use. It requests debugger, tabs, tabGroups and all-sites permissions.
2. Enable Browser Access for the selected PersonaBot. Computer Access can remain off.
3. In its Browser entry choose **Connect existing page**. In Chrome, select one existing HTTP(S) tab in the official connection page. Keep the connection dialog enabled; BotHarness does not use its bypass token.
4. Check the selected title and URL in BotHarness. **Connected · control not granted** allows no Bot observation or action yet. Choose **Allow control of this document** explicitly.
5. Ask the Bot to read or edit that page in DM. Approve its first Browser operation using the existing native Session approval. This target offers only observe, text input and clicks using current observation refs.
6. Choose **Pause Bot** to edit the page yourself, then **Resume**. The Bot must observe again before acting.
7. Choose **Return tab** to end the grant. Your tab stays open.

Navigation or reload, closing/removing the selected tab, extension disconnection, Access removal, target/profile changes and Host restart also end control. Reconnect and explicitly authorize again. Adding tabs to an extension group does not expand the Bot's document grant. The Human continues using their own Chrome window; this target does not provide a Container Viewer, screenshots, navigation or the other managed Browser tools.

The connector is pinned to `playwright-core@1.64.0-alpha-1790635538000` and official extension protocol 2. A connection waiting for tab selection can be cancelled from the Browser entry. Errors appear there; if the extension is missing, install it in the profile Chrome opens, then retry. Managed Local/Docker Browser and read-only Daily Browser retain their existing behavior.

Input and clicks bring the authorized tab to the foreground; observation does not switch tabs.

## Chrome Profile control

Choose **Browser Target → Daily Chrome · Entire Profile** to explicitly authorize this wider mode. It is separate from the read-only extension and Microsoft's single-document extension.

1. Load `packages/browser/profile-extension` (or `profile-extension` in the installed Browser package) using **chrome://extensions → Developer mode → Load unpacked**. This first-party extension is currently unpacked source, not a Chrome Store release. It requests tabs, scripting, debugger, local storage and ordinary HTTP(S) site access; private tabs are excluded.
2. In BotHarness, choose **Pair Chrome Profile**. Enter the local Host address and single-use five-minute code in the **BotHarness Chrome Profile Control** popup. Check **Allow Profile-wide Browser control**, then pair. Installing alone does not pair or grant a Bot access.
3. Enable Browser Access for the intended PersonaBot, approve its native Session action (unless you explicitly enabled automatic Browser approval), and ask it to list/select tabs. Computer Access can stay off. All existing/new ordinary webpage tabs in this Chrome Profile are discoverable; pairing is not repeated after navigation/reload.
4. Tools in this slice: `browser_tabs` list/select, `browser_open` to navigate/reload the selected tab, `browser_observe`, ref-based `browser_type` and `browser_click`. Observe after selecting, navigation, Human input, Resume and each mutation. Creating/closing tabs, screenshots, keyboard, scroll and upload remain unsupported here.
5. Use **Pause Bot** before editing. Pause waits for issued work to drain; Resume requires fresh observation. Other enabled Bots share the paired Profile, with serialized operations and separate refs/selections.
6. Browser Access off blocks that Bot. **Forget Profile pairing** revokes the shared binding for all Bots. Browser/Host restart preserves pairing but clears live refs, selection and native Session authority. Use **Reconnect** in the extension if the transport stops. Chrome may refuse debugger attachment when DevTools or another debugger is attached; close the competing debugger and observe again.

Only a local HTTP Host is supported. Missing polling for 45 seconds makes the connection unavailable; commands time out after 12 seconds. Page changes or a refusal require a fresh observation. Native Chrome debugging indicators may appear during input. Repeated connection is not a consent shortcut into other Chrome Profiles. This slice is qualified with Chrome for Testing, not an assertion of Edge or full Local/Container tool parity.
