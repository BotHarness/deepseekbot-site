In a Bot DM or local group, open the **Channel sidebar** and click its gear, **Channel sidebar display settings**. These controls affect presentation, not the Bot’s model, Memory contents or execution permissions.

## Width and disclosure

- Drag the sidebar’s left separator to resize it. The default width is **320 px**, with a **260–560 px** range.
- Focus the separator and use Left/Right arrow keys for keyboard resizing; Home/End choose the minimum/maximum width.
- Click an entry title to expand/collapse it, and the edge toggle to close/open the whole column.
- In a narrow window, the sidebar opens as an overlay. Close it with its toggle, the backdrop or Escape. Changing the selected chat closes the temporary overlay.

## Order and visibility

1. Choose **Edit sidebar** in the gear menu.
2. Drag an entry’s handle to move it. Alternatively, focus the handle and use Up/Down arrow keys.
3. Use **Hide …** or **Show …** to choose which entries appear.
4. Click **Done** to save the draft, or **Cancel** to discard it.
5. **Restore defaults** resets the draft’s default order and visibility; click **Done** to apply it.

Hidden entries keep their data. If everything is hidden, use the gear menu to edit and show entries again. Bot and Channel layouts have separate ordering/visibility preferences; switching between Bots does not create a new Bot-specific order. Expanded/collapsed entries are remembered for the selected Bot or Channel. Preferences are stored in the current client browser; this guide does not promise that another browser or device shares them.

## Feature display settings

| Gear-menu option               | Choices and effect                                             |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory evolution · Terminology | **Memory** or **Git** labels/grouping; no repository change.   |
| Sessions · Session view        | **Current** or **All** for the selected Bot’s owned Sessions.  |
| Sessions · Layout              | **Flat** or **By workspace**; groups do not relocate Sessions. |

These menu selections apply immediately. They are separate from the **Edit sidebar** draft’s **Done/Cancel** buttons. Opening a feature settings submenu can temporarily preview that entry; closing the menu restores its ordinary disclosure state.

For details, read [Memory evolution](/docs/channel-sidebar/memory-evolution) and [Sessions](/docs/channel-sidebar/sessions). Optional plugins may add their own display settings when available. [All sidebar features](/docs/channel-sidebar).
