Open **Bot DM → Channel sidebar → Sessions**. The list contains this PersonaBot’s owned DSH Sessions. A Channel chat is the shared message surface; a Session shows the model execution and tools behind it.

## Open and return

1. Expand **Sessions** and choose a row.
2. DSH opens the native Session. Inspect its conversation, trajectory, tool results, model selector and permission controls there.
3. Click the Bot-labelled **Back to …** control in the native header to return to the Bot chat.

| Information                      | Meaning                                                                                                              |

| Orchestrator                     | The Bot’s dialogue and coordination Session.                                                                         |
| Assignment                       | A task execution Session owned by this Bot; its working directory and permissions belong to that task.               |
| Running / Stopping / Stopped     | Execution or stop lifecycle state.                                                                                   |
| Idle                             | The native Session exists and is not currently running; it is not proof that the overall task is complete.           |
| Needs attention                  | An Assignment has reported an error state; open it to inspect the cause.                                             |
| Session unavailable              | The native Session is absent from the current catalog; the row cannot be opened.                                     |
| Full-access marker, when present | That Assignment’s stored permission choice; review its actual Session before drawing conclusions about another task. |

## Select the scope and layout

Use the sidebar’s gear menu:

- **Sessions · Session view → Current** keeps the latest Orchestrator, running/stopping work, attention states and certain unresolved working Sessions. It can hide finished historical Assignments.
- **Sessions · Session view → All** includes historical owned Sessions; it still does not list unrelated Bots’ Sessions.
- **Sessions · Layout → Flat** gives one list with working-directory labels.
- **Sessions · Layout → By workspace** groups by working directory. Expand a group to see its rows; a group count is a Session count.

These settings change the list presentation. They do not move a Session, grant a folder, stop an Agent or change a model. If a task seems missing, try **All** and check that you opened the intended Bot.

For choosing future Bot/task models, use [API and Bot models](/docs/model-setup); for file access, use [Workspace Grants](/docs/channel-sidebar/workspaces). [Sidebar overview](/docs/channel-sidebar).
