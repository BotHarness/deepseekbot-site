Open **Bot DM → Channel sidebar → Memory evolution**. This entry separates the repository’s current uncommitted changes from its Git history. Reading a diff does not apply it or revert a file.

## Inspect a change

1. Expand **Memory evolution**.
2. In **Current Memory**, expand a change group and click a file to open its **Uncommitted diff** in the center.
3. In **Commit history**, click a commit row to open its changed files and **Commit diff**.
4. Click **Back to chat** when finished. Use **Load more commits** to inspect older history.

| Control or label                        | Meaning                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| New Memory / Updates to existing Memory | A friendlier grouping of uncommitted working-tree changes.                                                               |
| Unstaged / Staged / Untracked           | The corresponding Git grouping when the display terminology is **Git**.                                                  |
| HEAD and branch labels                  | The checked-out commit and references in the Git graph.                                                                  |
| Recorded / Git commit / Needs repair    | BotHarness checkpoint annotations on Git history; they do not establish who authored the files or approve their content. |

Change the terminology through **Channel sidebar display settings → Memory evolution · Display terminology**. This changes labels and grouping, not repository contents.

## Request a branch switch

Select an existing branch in **Search branches**, then click **Switch**. The interface sends a request to this Bot’s Orchestrator; selecting an item alone does not check out a branch. Wait for the Bot’s result and verify the displayed branch and current files. If Git refuses because of unfinished changes, keep the changes and inspect the Bot’s report.

From a commit diff, **Create and switch branch from this memory** opens a new-branch name field. **Create and switch** also sends a Bot request; it creates a branch from that commit rather than undoing later commits on the original branch. Confirm the operation and resulting files after the Bot completes it.

## Recovery checkpoints

**Recovery checkpoints** preserve an observed branch, HEAD, index and working tree. Their source says when BotHarness observed or acted on the repository, not who wrote its Git files.

Choose a checkpoint only when you intend to restore that state, inspect the branch/commit in the confirmation, then use **Back up and restore**. Restoration backs up the pre-restore repository and shows the backup location. It changes current Memory, so ordinary reading and branch requests are separate procedures. A **Repair Memory** state has its own confirmation and backup procedure.

The screenshots demonstrate reading the real repository and commit diff. They do not demonstrate a recovery or claim that the example repository needed repair.
