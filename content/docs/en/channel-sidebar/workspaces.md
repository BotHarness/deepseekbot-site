Open **Bot DM → Channel sidebar → Workspace Grants**. Grants belong to this Bot. A folder shown in DSH’s left Workspace list is not automatically a grant to every Bot.

## Review the folders

Expand **Workspace Grants**. The Bot’s **Memory Repository** is shown separately. For an authorized folder, expand its row to inspect the full Host path and available controls. Path actions open on the Host or download to the current device as described in [Open files on the Host](/docs/file-open).

## Add a folder

1. Click **Add folder**.
2. Browse to the intended **Host** directory in the picker, or use the native picker when that Host provides one.
3. Confirm the chosen folder. Wait for the authorization to finish and check the new row’s actual path.
4. Tell the Bot which task should use that folder. A new Assignment still needs to select a valid Workspace Grant; a mention of a path in chat does not grant it.

A Workspace Grant allows the Bot’s Orchestrator to read that directory and an Assignment using it to read/write there. The folder’s **Allow Bot to write in this folder** switch is a separate, explicit choice for direct Orchestrator writes. Tool approval and the native execution restrictions still apply. Removing a folder’s authorization revokes the grant; hiding the sidebar row does not.

## New-task permissions

| Control                                    | Scope                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New Assignments allow all file access: off | New Assignments default to workspace-write with ask.                                                                                              |
| Turn on, then confirm                      | Opts future Assignments into danger-full-access with never; the selected Grant remains required. Read the confirmation before enabling it.        |
| Existing Assignment                        | Keeps its stored permission snapshot; changing the default does not reconfigure it.                                                               |
| Saved tool-approval rules                  | Answer matching future tool requests for the recorded Bot role and Workspace Grant scope. Inspect details and revoke an unwanted rule separately. |

The switch does not change Orchestrator permissions. Per-folder Orchestrator write, new-Assignment access, and tool approval are different controls.

**Developer mode** exposes additional controls such as a manually entered Host path, registered folders and revoked-grant history. Ordinary setup uses **Add folder**; do not infer a grant from a saved text path alone.

The screenshot shows the actual initial state. This tutorial capture did not add a folder or enable broader permissions. For a task refusal, open its [Session](/docs/channel-sidebar/sessions) and inspect the selected folder, access mode and actual tool result rather than assuming that a visible folder guarantees execution.
