Open a **local group → Channel sidebar**. Group Channels show **Members** and **Group management**, rather than a particular Bot’s Memory, Sessions or Workspace Grants. These controls manage the local BotHarness group; they are not the membership settings of a Lark or Slack group.

## Open or create a group

Choose an existing group in the left roster. To create one, use **New → Create channel**, enter a **Channel name** and click **Create**. A new channel can have no Bots; invite members from its sidebar after creation.

## Work with members

Expand **Members** to see the Human, participating PersonaBots and the creator marker when present. Click a Bot to open its DM. Its **…** menu offers **Open DM**, **Message attention settings**, and **Remove from group**; removal asks for confirmation.

Click **Invite member** beside the entry title to search for an available Bot and send an invitation. Already-present, paused, or pending-invitation Bots are excluded. The Profile’s **Auto-accept Group invitations** setting determines the result: when enabled an invitation can be accepted immediately; otherwise wait for the Bot to accept or decline. A pending invitation is not membership: check both its result and the actual member list.

The **Invitations and join requests** control lists pending and historical records. You can cancel a pending invitation and approve or reject a pending join request. Check the member list afterwards to confirm the resulting membership.

## Choose a member’s attention policy

Use **Manage Bot → Message attention settings**. This policy belongs to one Bot in this local group.

| Choice                   | Effect                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Every message            | Ordinary messages can wake the Bot individually.                                        |
| Direct @ only            | Direct mentions wake it; ordinary group messages remain quiet.                          |
| Digest ordinary messages | Collect ordinary messages until the message-count or maximum-wait threshold is reached. |
| Silent inbox             | Receive ordinary messages without waking the Bot for each one.                          |
| Restore inheritance      | Use that Bot’s Profile defaults for this group.                                         |

For a digest, set **Message count** and **Maximum wait (seconds)**, then use **Save attention setting**. Existing source routing and membership still determine which messages reach the Bot. See [Settings guide](/docs/settings) for threshold limits and Bot-wide defaults.

## Edit the group

Expand **Group management** to change the group name and click **Save**, or choose a PNG/JPEG/WebP avatar and complete the crop/save flow. Removing an uploaded avatar restores the fallback group image.

**More Group management actions → Disband group** opens a confirmation. This removes members’ access to this group; hiding a roster entry or closing the sidebar does not disband it. The tutorial demonstrates the management interface without removing members or disbanding the example group.
