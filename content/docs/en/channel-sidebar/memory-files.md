Open a **Bot DM → Channel sidebar → Memory files**. The tree belongs to this PersonaBot’s Memory Repository, not the folder used by an Assignment. A new Bot can have only initialization files; useful topic files appear as you or the Bot save them.

`SOUL.md` and `MEMORY.md` at the root are pinned at the top with a **Standing** badge and their character usage: both go into the system prompt at the start of every new Session. See [Bot Soul and Core Memory](/docs/soul-and-core-memory) for what they are for, their limits, and when edits apply.

## Read a file

1. Expand **Memory files** and any folder containing the file.
2. Click a filename. Its current contents open in the center, temporarily replacing the chat history and composer.
3. Use **Refresh** in the file view to fetch its latest contents.
4. Click **Back to chat** to return to the same conversation.

The preview is a reader. To change a file, ask the Bot to update it, or use an editor on the Host. For example: “Save my preference in `replies.md`: start with the conclusion, then give the steps.” Confirm the result by opening the actual file. Topic filenames and folders are your convention; the repository can also contain code and binary files.

## File actions

Use the row’s **…**, its context menu, or the file view’s action control. Depending on the Host, the menu offers opening in a native application, showing the file’s location, downloading to the current device, or copying its Host path. Folder actions do not download a folder as a file. See [Open files on the Host](/docs/file-open) for availability and the distinction between the Host and your browser device.

## Current files and history

This tree shows the current checked-out working tree, including uncommitted content. A Git commit is not an extra acceptance gate for a file to become Memory. Use [Memory evolution](/docs/channel-sidebar/memory-evolution) to inspect changes and history separately.

| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No Memory files           | Ask the Bot to save a useful topic file, then reopen or refresh the view.                                  |
| File no longer exists     | Refresh the tree and select a current path.                                                                |
| Binary or oversized file  | The reader does not provide a text preview; use file actions or ask the Bot to inspect it with its tools.  |
| Loading or update failure | Check the displayed error and use **Retry**; a previous preview may remain visible while the update fails. |
