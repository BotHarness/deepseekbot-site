## Install the plugin

Follow the [illustrated installation guide](/docs/installation): open DSH **Plugins → Add plugin**, enter `deepseekbot@0.1.0-alpha.1`, install it and click **Enable now**. This public npm prerelease was verified with DSH `0.2.0-rc.1`.

## Configure an API provider

Open **Settings → Models** and configure a provider’s endpoint, credentials, and model catalog. Follow the illustrated [API and Bot model guide](/docs/model-setup).

## Create your first PersonaBot

Open **Bot mode**, choose **Create your first PersonaBot**, enter a name and create it. Open its DM and click its header name/avatar → **View details → Model preset**. Choose Orchestrator and Assignment models and **Create and apply**. Return to chat and verify a real reply.

## Connect a messaging app

After the local DM works, follow [Connect a Bot to Lark / Feishu](/docs/lark-connection). Connection, identity binding and group authorization are separate steps.


## Explore the Channel sidebar

The [Channel sidebar chapter](/docs/channel-sidebar) has an overview and separate guides for Memory files and evolution, Sessions, Bot Inbox, Workspace Grants, local group management, and display/layout. Open a Bot DM or group and follow the matching guide.

## Adjust other settings

The [Settings guide](/docs/settings) explains global preferences, Bot concurrency/name, persona/avatar, attention, sidebar views, workspace grants, and when changes apply.
